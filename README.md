# PokemonProject

This is an app which users can learn common pokemons' names, images and abilities.In first screen, there is a table view to list all pokemons.In tableView cells, user can see pokemon's name and image.If you want to learn more about one of these pokemons, you can click the button that says discover.When user clicked the button, program switches user to other screen.In this screen there are big image of pokemon, it's name and the ability list below.I benefitted MVVM architecture, Protocol Oriented Programming, OOP.I made data transfers through protocols.There are ServiceProtocol, ViewModel Protocol and ViewProtocol for each screen.ViewModel creates data from initialized ServiceProtocol getter.Then it transfer this data to ViewProtocol.In view class, we are using this data.But for these processes, ViewModel must know who is the viewProtocol.So, I created a setdelegate function to make relation between viewModel and View.Here are some photos in my app.
